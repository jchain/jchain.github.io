But today I found that the milestone feature
in Trac very impressive. At the beginning of a project I can file all the tasks, to-dos, required
features to the issue tracking system for a specific milestone. By viewing the progress bar, I can
have a clear big picture about the progress of the project. I like this feature very much. Very
helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Project management"></category></entry></feed>
